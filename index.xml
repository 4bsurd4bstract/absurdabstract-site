    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the culmination of some preliminary research into instilling fear using sound. This project was inspired by the findings of several papers, and foley practices in film. The concept was to simulate a dangerous environment by using sound and visuals that recalled childhood vulnerabilities, instinctual fears, and player experience/expectations of horror films. So far, this project hasn&amp;rsquo;t certifiably proven anything, but still turned out to be good practical experience with Unreal Engine, metasounds, and sound design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;deep-fear&#34;&gt;Deep Fear&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience I wished to create in &amp;ldquo;A House in a Storm&amp;rdquo; was a deep-rooted, subconcious, unexplainable fear. The kind of feeling that takes a front seat, but defies reason. This goal inspired the setting and premise for my game. The player views this big, dark house from the perspective of a child who has been left home alone. When the power goes out, they are left in the dark in an almost familiar space. This is home, but not their home. Conceptually, the player shares their characters perspective as they are also in an unfamiliar home-like space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He did not like the cellar, and he did not like going down the cellar stairs, because he always imagined there was something down there in the dark. That was silly, of course, his father said so and his mother said so and, even more important, Bill said so, but still&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; - Stephen King, It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound systems I implemented attempt to emphasize the possibilities of something lurking in the dark, without giving the player any concrete answers. The walls creak, pipes twang, and mice scurry in the floors. Every sound is created using a metasounds system, that blends different samples togeather, making sure not a single sound is heard in the same way (or in the same place) twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-acoustics&#34;&gt;Project Acoustics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to Project Acoustics as a way to realistically simulate the attenuation and spatialization of my sounds. Project acoustics bakes the sound attenuation information of an area into an array, based on spatial dimensions and wall materials. The upside is that this method allows for a very fast and very accurate simulation of how sound would behave in a space. Unfortunately this baking process is very slow, and also results in a very large data file.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Most Holiday Song</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how so many cultures independantly came up with their own holidays designed to bring light to the darkest season of the year. This is a song about that. Ho Ho Ho.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obelisk Prototype Synth Controller</title>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsFRM4SbFpw?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that this looks like four controllers duct taped togeather, you would be right.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with this interface for the control of computer synthesizers (such as VCV rack patches) and it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a bit of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite quality of this interface is that there is equal capacity for solo and collaberative performance due to the excess of buttons and joysticks. There is no way to accurately control every aspect of these programs all at once which can result in some very surprising and stimulating sonic landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing project, and will most likely end up coding something custom for this interface to control sound and visuals simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Am Apollo</title>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sz6mN_u1FYM?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was originally created for an 8 channel speaker array.
The concept was that each pulsating sound would rotate around the listeners head at a rate proportional to the orbit of a planet. The pulsing was proportional to the planets day length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound of the planets was decided without much thought, so one day I would like to rerecord this piece with something other than garbage-sounding midi-instruments. The only sounds I do appreciate are sonified data from several planets, which I took from NASA&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This version was decoded into binaural, so headphones are recommended for the best listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;
